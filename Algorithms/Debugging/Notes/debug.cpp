//ll vs int? overflow?

//+1 / -1? include starting node? don't? mark as seen?
//special cases? include y as vowel?
//n-1 vs n?
//0 to size? 0 to size-1? 1 to size? check bounds

//stuck? the problem is bullshit? mess around with the bounds

//try stupider methods that could work

//the max is too high? lower it.

//if you remove a line and the code functions without error, 
//was that line wrong? or was it something the line changed?

//shared variables (two is iterating, two xs counting, variable defined higher, etc.)

//redfined variable

//didn't reset an array / variable?

//don't switch around function values! memset(obj,val,sizeof obj)

//put parentheses around bit operators (x>>1), (x<<1)

//run program multiple times, see if that changes anything
