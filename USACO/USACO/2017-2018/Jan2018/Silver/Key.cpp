Read through ALL the problems FIRST; sketch notes with algorithm, complexity, the numbers, data structs, tricky details, ...

Brainstorm many possible algorithms - then pick the stupidest that works!

DO THE MATH! - DOES BRUTE FORCE WORK? 

Sometimes there is no tricky solution

(space & time complexity, and plug in actual expected and worst case numbers)
Try to break the algorithm - use special (degenerate?) test cases

Order the problems: shortest job first, in terms of your effort (shortest to longest: done it before, easy, unfamiliar, hard)

Coding a problem - For each, one at a time:

Finalize algorithm

Create test data for tricky cases

Write data structures

Code the input routine and test it (write extra output routines to show data?)

Code the output routine and test it

Stepwise refinement: write comments outlining the program logic

Fill in code and debug one section at a time

Get it working & verify correctness (use trivial test cases)

Try to break the code - use special cases for code correctness

Optimize progressively - only as much as needed, and keep all versions (use hard test cases to figure out actual runtime)
