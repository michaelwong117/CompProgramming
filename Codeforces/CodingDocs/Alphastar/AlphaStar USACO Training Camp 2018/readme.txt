Welcome to A-Star USACO Training Camp 2018!

This camp is only for USACO Platinum division students.
This training is composed of four IOI level exams each of which has 3 problems to be solved in 3.5 hours.
In each exam section below, you will see the problem information including problem name, memory and time limits then two different links: one of C/C++ users, one for Java users. Choose the language whichever suits you.
You will see the test feedback after your submission. Click on 'Attempt quiz now' button. You can nagivate through the questions using the navigation panel on the left side. You can start working on any problem you want.


Submission instructions:

There is no file input and output anymore. Just use standard input and output (cin/cout in C++, System.in/out in Java)
You will see the 'Answer' box under the problem statement. You need to copy and paste your working code to that box. Please make sure that your code is working in your computer before checking it here.
After pasting your code into the box, click on 'Check' button to run the automated grader and see if your solution is working. Your code will be tested with inputs in the system which is very similar to USACO's system. You will see the input, expected output and your output for your convenience. You can check your code unlimited times.
To finish the exam and to have your offical score, you need to finish the attempt by clicking 'Finish attemp' link under the navigation panel.
