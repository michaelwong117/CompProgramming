Fish

--------------------

In a small coastal country, all towns are situated on a long 
coastline (which we will model as a straight line). A long 
straight road runs along the coast, connecting the towns. The 
position of each town can be described by a single non-negative 
integer - the distance (in kilometers) from the start of the road.

Most of the citizens are fishermen, and they catch great amounts 
of fish. After the fishing season is over and before the tourist 
season starts, the fish can be transported between different 
towns. A town can accommodate X tourists if it has X tons of fish 
available. The goal is to accommodate the largest possible number 
of tourists while distributing them evenly between towns. In other 
words, we want to find the largest integer Y for which it is 
possible to distribute fish so that each town can accommodate at 
least Y tourists.

In one shipment, an integral number of tons of fish is sent from 
one town to another. During transportation, one ton of fish per 
kilometer traveled is lost to hungry pillagers descending from the 
mountains. More formally, if a town ships F tons of fish to another 
town that is D kilometers away, then F-D tons will arrive at the 
destination; if F is less than D, then the entire shipment is lost.

It is possible to arbitrarily repackage and combine shipments in 
intermediate towns. For example, we can send shipments from towns 
A and B to town C, combine half of the remaining fish from both 
shipments with the fish originating in C and send it in a single 
large shipment from town C to town D.

TASK:

Write a program that, given the positions of all towns and the 
amount of fish each town produces, determines the largest number 
of tourists that can be accommodated by each city after the fish 
has been distributed.

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains an integer N, 1 <= N <= 100,000, 
the number of towns.

Each of the following N lines contains two integers P and F, 
0 <= P, F <= 10^12, the position of a town (in kilometers) and the 
amount of fish it produces (in tons). The towns will be sorted in 
ascending order of position. The positions of all towns will be 
distinct.

In 50% of all test cases, N will be at most 100 and each town will 
produce at most 100 tons of fish.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The first and only line of output should contain the largest number 
of tourists Y from the task description.
