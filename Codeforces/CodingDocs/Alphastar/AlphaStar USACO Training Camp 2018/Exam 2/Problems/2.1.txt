Trail Maintenance
======================

--------------------

Farmer John's cows wish to travel freely among the N (1 <= N <= 200) 
fields (numbered 1...N) on the farm, even though the fields are 
separated by forest. The cows wish to maintain trails between pairs 
of fields so that they can travel from any field to any other field 
using the maintained trails. Cows may travel along a maintained trail 
in either direction.

The cows do not build trails. Instead, they maintain wild animal 
trails that they have discovered. On any week, they can choose to 
maintain any or all of the wild animal trails they know about.

Always curious, the cows discover one new wild animal trail at the 
beginning of each week. They must then decide the set of trails to 
maintain for that week so that they can travel from any field to 
any other field. Cows can only use trails which they are currently
maintaining.

The cows always want to minimize the total length of trail they 
must maintain. The cows can choose to maintain any subset of the 
wild animal trails they know about, regardless of which trails were 
maintained the previous week.

Wild animal trails (even when maintained) are never straight. Two 
trails that connect the same two fields might have different lengths. 
While two trails might cross, cows are so focused, they refuse to 
switch trails except when they are in a field. 

At the beginning of each week, the cows will describe the wild 
animal trail they discovered. Your program must then output the 
minimum total length of trail the cows must maintain that week so 
that they can travel from any field to any other field, if there
exists such a set of trails.

Input format:

* The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, 
N and W. W is the number of weeks the program will cover (1 <= W 
<= 6000).

* For each week, read a single line containing the wild animal 
trail that was discovered. This line contains three space-separated 
integers: the endpoints (field numbers) and the integer length of 
that trail (1...10000). No wild animal trail has the same field as 
both of its endpoints.

Output format:

Immediately after your program learns about the newly discovered 
wild animal trail, it should output a single line with the minimum 
total length of trail the cows must maintain so that they can 
travel from any field to any other field. If no set of trails allows 
the cows to travel from any field to any other field, output "-1".

Your program must exit after outputting the answer for the last week.
