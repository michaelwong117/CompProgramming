Famous ancient Greek sculptor Phidias is making preparations to 
build another marvelous monument. For this purpose he needs 
rectangular marble plates of sizes W1 x H1, W2 x H2, ..., WN x HN.

Recently, Phidias has received a large rectangular marble slab. 
He wants to cut the slab to obtain plates of the desired sizes. 
Any piece of marble (the slab or the plates cut from it) can be 
cut either horizontally or vertically into two rectangular plates 
with integral widths and heights, cutting completely through that 
piece. This is the only way to cut pieces and pieces cannot be 
joined together. Since the marble has a pattern on it, the plates 
cannot be rotated: if Phidias cuts a plate of size A x B then it 
cannot be used as a plate of size B x A unless A = B. He can make 
zero or more plates of each desired size. A marble plate is wasted 
if it is not of any of the desired sizes after all cuts are 
completed. Phidias wonders how to cut the initial slab so that as 
little of it as possible will be wasted.

As an example, assume that in the figure below the width of the 
original slab is 21 and the height of the original slab is 11, 
and the desired plate sizes are 10 x 4, 6 x 2, 7 x 5, and 15 x 10. 
The minimum possible area wasted is 10, and the figure shows one 
sequence of cuts with total waste area of size 10.

Your task is to write a program that, given the size of the original 
slab and the desired plate sizes, calculates the minimum total area 
of the original slab that must be wasted.

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains two integers: first W, the width 
of the original slab, and then H, the height of the original slab. 
The second line contains one integer N: the number of desired 
plate sizes. The following N lines contain the desired plate sizes. 
Each of these lines contains two integers: first the width Wi and 
then the height Hi of that desired plate size (1 <= i <= N).

In all inputs, 1 <= W <= 600, 1 <= H <= 600, 0 < N <= 200, 
1 <= Wi <= W, and 1 <= Hi <= H.
Additionally, in 50% of the inputs, W <= 20, H <= 20 and N <= 5.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The output is to contain one line with a single integer: the minimum 
total area of the original slab that must be wasted.
