The ancient mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras believed that 
reality is mathematical in nature. Present-day biologists study 
properties of biosequences. A biosequence is a sequence of M 
integers, which 

* contains each of the numbers 0,1,...,M-1,
* starts with 0 and ends with M-1, and
* has no two elements E,E+1 in adjacent positions in this order.

A subsequence consisting of adjacent elements of a biosequence is 
called a segment.

A segment of a biosequence is called a framed interval if it 
includes all integers whose values are between the value of the 
first element, which must be the smallest element in the segment, 
and the last element, which must be the largest and different from 
the first. A framed interval is called an empodio if it does not 
contain any shorter framed intervals.

As an example, consider the biosequence (0,3,5,4,6,2,1,7). The 
whole biosequence is a framed interval. However, it contains 
another framed interval (3,5,4,6) and therefore it is not an 
empodio. The framed interval (3,5,4,6) does not contain a shorter 
framed interval, so it is an empodio. Furthermore, it is the only 
empodio in that biosequence.

You are to write a program that, given a biosequence, finds all 
empodia (plural for empodio) in that biosequence.

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line contains a single integer M: the number of integers 
in the input biosequence. The following M lines contain the integers 
of the biosequence in the order of the sequence. Each of these M 
lines contains a single integer.

In one input, 1,000,000 <= M <= 1,100,000. In all other inputs, 
1 <= M <= 60000. Additionally, in 50% of the inputs, M <= 2600.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The first line contains one integer H: the number of empodia in 
the input biosequence. The following H lines describe all empodia 
of the input biosequence in the order of appearance of the starting 
point in the biosequence. Each of these lines is to contain two 
integers A and B (in that order) separated by a space, where the 
Ath element of the input biosequence is the first element of the
empodio and the Bth element of the input biosequence is the last 
element of the empodio.
