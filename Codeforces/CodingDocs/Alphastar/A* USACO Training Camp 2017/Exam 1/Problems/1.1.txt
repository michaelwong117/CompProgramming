A Huge Tower

-------------------

The ancient Babylonians decided to build a huge tower. The tower 
consists of N cubic building blocks that are stacked one onto 
another. The Babylonians gathered many building blocks of various 
sizes from all over the country. From their last unsuccessful 
attempt they have learned that if they put a large block directly 
onto a much smaller block, the tower will fall.

Each two building blocks are different, even if they have the same
size. For each building block you are given its side length. You 
are also given an integer D with the following meaning: you are 
not allowed to put block A directly onto block B if the side length 
of A is strictly larger than D plus the side length of B. Compute 
the number of different ways in which it is possible to build the 
tower using all the building blocks. Since this number can be very 
large, output the result modulo 10^9 + 9.

PROBLEM NAME: tower

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of the input contains two positive integers N and D: 
the number of building blocks and the tolerance respectively.

The second line contains N space-separated integers; each represents 
the size of one building block.

* All numbers in the input files are positive integers not exceeding 
10^9.
* N is always at least 2.
* In test cases worth 70 points N will be at most 70.
* Out of those, in test cases worth 45 points, N will be at most 20.
* Out of those, in test cases worth 10 points, N will be at most 10.
* For some of the test cases the total number of valid towers will 
not exceed 1,000,000. These test cases are worth 30 points in total.
* For the last six test cases (worth 30 points) the value of N is 
larger than 70. No upper bound on N is given for these test cases.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output a single line containing a single integer: the number of towers 
that can be built, modulo 10^9 + 9.

EXAMPLES:

Input:
4 1
1 2 3 100

Output:
4

We can arrange the first three blocks in any order, except for 2,1,3 
or 1,3,2. The last block has to be at the bottom.

Input:
6 9
10 20 20 10 10 20

Output:
36

We are not allowed to put a cube of size 20 onto a cube of size 10. 
There are six ways to order the cubes of size 10, and six ways to 
order the cubes of size 20.
