Bonny needs to cut a slab of chocolate with raisins. The chocolate 
is a rectangular block of identical square pieces. The pieces are 
aligned with the edges of the chocolate, and they are arranged in 
N rows and M columns, for a total of N*M pieces. Each piece has
one or more raisins on it, and no raisins lie between or across
pieces.

Initially, the chocolate is one single, monolithic block. Bonny
needs to cut it into smaller and smaller blocks until finally 
she has cut the chocolate down to its N*M individual pieces. 
As Bonny is very busy, she needs the help of her assistant, 
Sly Peter, to do the cutting. Peter only makes straight line, 
end-to-end cuts and he wants to be paid for every single cut he 
makes. Bonny has no money at hand, but she has plenty of raisins 
left over, so she offers to pay Peter in raisins. Sly Peter agrees 
to this arrangement, but under the following condition: every time 
he cuts a given block of chocolate into two smaller blocks, he has 
to be paid as many raisins as there are on the block he was given.

Bonny wants to pay Peter as little as possible. She knows how many 
raisins there are on each of the N*M pieces. She can choose the 
order in which she gives Peter any remaining blocks, and she can 
also tell Peter what cuts to make (horizontal or vertical) and 
where exactly to make them. Help Bonny decide how to cut the 
chocolate into individual pieces, so that she pays Sly Peter as 
few raisins as possible.

Write a program that, given the number of raisins on each of the 
individual pieces, determines the minimum number of raisins that 
Bonny will have to pay Sly Peter.

* 1 <= N, M <= 50 The number of pieces on each side of the chocolate
* 1 <= R_{k,p} <= 1000 The number of raisins on the piece in the 
kth row and the pth column

PROBLEM NAME: raisins

INPUT FORMAT:

Your program must read from standard input the following data:

* The first line contains the integers N and M, separated by a 
single space.

* The next N lines describe how many raisins there are on each 
piece of the chocolate. The kth of these N lines describes the 
kth row of the chocolate. Each such line contains M integers
separated by single spaces. The integers describe the pieces on 
the corresponding row in order from left to right. The pth 
integer on the kth line (among these N lines) tells you how many 
raisins are on the piece in the kth row and the pth column.

For a number of tests, worth a total of 25 points, N and M will 
not exceed 7.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Your program must write to standard output a single line 
containing a single integer: the minimum possible number of 
raisins that Bonny would have to pay Sly Peter.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2 3
2 7 5
1 9 5

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

77

OUTPUT DETAILS:

One possible way (out of many) to achieve a cost of 77 is as follows:

2 7 5    2 7 | 5    2 7 | 5    2 | 7 | 5    2 | 7 | 5
                         --    -- --- --    -- --- --    
1 9 5    1 9 | 5    1 9 | 5    1 9   | 5    1 | 9 | 5

The first cut that Bonny asks Peter to make separates the third 
column from the rest of the chocolate. Bonny needs to pay Peter 29 
raisins for this.

Then Bonny gives Peter the smaller of the two blocks: the one that 
has two pieces with 5 raisins each, and asks Peter to cut the block 
in two in exchange for 10 raisins.

After this, Bonny gives Peter the largest remaining block: the one 
having pieces with 2, 7, 1 and 9 raisins respectively. Bonny asks 
Peter to cut it horizontally, separating the first and the second
row and pays him 19 raisins.

Following this, Bonny gives Peter the top-left block, paying 9 
raisins. Finally, Bonny asks Peter to split the bottom-left block, 
paying 10 raisins.

The total cost to Bonny is 29 + 10 + 19 + 9 + 10 = 77 raisins. No 
other cutting arrangement can get the chocolate cut into its 6 
pieces at a smaller cost.
