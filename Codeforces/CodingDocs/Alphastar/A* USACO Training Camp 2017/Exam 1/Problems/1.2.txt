The MP3 Player

-------------------

Bessie's new MP3 player has many interesting features, one of them 
being the key lock. All the keys are locked after more than T 
seconds of inactivity. After the key lock is engaged, no key 
performs its original function, but if any key is pressed, the key 
lock is disengaged.

For example, assume that T = 5 and the player is currently locked. 
Bessie presses the key A, waits for 3 seconds, presses the key B, 
waits for 5 seconds, presses C, waits for 6 seconds, and presses D. 
In this case only the keys B and C perform their regular functions. 
Note that the keys became locked between C and D was pressed.

Sound level of the MP3 player is controlled by the + and - keys, 
increasing and decreasing volume by 1 unit respectively. The sound 
level is an integer between 0 and V_max. Pressing the + key at volume 
V_max or pressing the - key at volume 0 leaves the volume unchanged.

Bessie does not know the value of T. She wanted to find it by an 
experiment. Starting with a locked keyboard, she pressed a sequence 
of N + and - keys. At the end of the experiment Bessie read the final 
volume from the player's display. Unfortunately, she forgot to note 
the volume before her first keypress. For the purpose of this task, 
the unknown initial volume will be denoted V_1 and the known final 
volume will be denoted V_2.

You are given the value V_2 and a list of keystrokes in the order 
in which Bessie made them. For each key, you are given the type of 
the key (+ or -) and the number of seconds from the beginning of 
the experiment to the moment when the key was pressed. The task 
is to find the largest possible integer value of T which is
consistent with the outcome of the experiment.

PROBLEM NAME: mp3

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers 
N, V_max and V_2 (0 <= V_2 <= V_max). Each of the next N lines 
contains a description of one key in the sequence: a character 
+ or -, a space and an integer C_i (0 <= C_i <= 2 x 10^9), the 
number of seconds from the beginning of the experiment. You may 
assume that the keypresses are in sorted order and that all times 
are distinct (i.e., C_i < C_{i + 1} for all 1 <= i < N).

* You may assume that 2 <= N <= 100,000 and 2 <= V_max <= 5000.
* In test cases worth 40 points N <= 4000.
* In test cases worth 70 points N x V_max <= 400,000.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

If T can be arbitrarily large, output a single line containing the 
word "infinity" (quotes for clarity).

Otherwise, output a single line containing two integers T and V_1 
separated by a single space.

The values must be such that carrying out the experiment with 
locking time T starting at volume V_1 gives the final volume V_2. 
If there are multiple possible answers, output the one with the 
largest T; if there are still multiple possible answers, output 
the one with the largest V_1.

(Note that at least one solution always exists: for T = 0 none of 
the keys performs its action, so it suffices to take V_1 = V_2.)

EXAMPLES:

Input:
6 4 3
- 0
+ 8
+ 9
+ 13
- 19
- 24

Output:
5 4

For T = 5 the keys perform the following actions: unlock, unlock, 
+, +, unlock, -. For any we would get V_2 = 3. Note that the output 
contains the largest possible V_1. For the last two keystrokes will 
both be active, hence it will be impossible to have V_2 = 3.

Input:
3 10 10
+ 1
+ 2
+ 47

Output:
infinity

If V_1 = 10 then for any T we'll have V_2 = 10.
