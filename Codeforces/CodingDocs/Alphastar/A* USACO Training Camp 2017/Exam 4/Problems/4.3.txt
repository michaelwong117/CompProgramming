-------------------

In 1964 a catastrophic flood struck the city of Los Angeles. Many 
buildings were completely destroyed when the water struck their 
walls. In this task, you are given a simplified model of the city 
before the flood and you should determine which of the walls are 
left intact after the flood.

The model consists of N points in the coordinate plane and W walls. 
Each wall connects a pair of points and does not go through any 
other points. The model has the following additional properties:

* No two walls intersect or overlap, but they may touch at endpoints;
* Each wall is parallel to either the horizontal or the vertical 
coordinate axis.

Initially, the entire coordinate plane is dry. At time zero, water 
instantly floods the exterior (the space not bounded by walls). 
After exactly one hour, every wall with water on one side and air 
on the other breaks under the pressure of water. Water then floods 
the new area not bounded by any standing walls. Now, there may be
new walls having water on one side and air on the other. After 
another hour, these walls also break down and water floods further. 
This procedure repeats until water has flooded the entire area.

An example of the process is shown in the following figure:

The state at time zero. Shaded cells represent the flooded area, while
white cells represent dry area (air).

[4.3_diagram_2.png]

The state after one hour.

[4.3_diagram_3.png]

The state after two hours. Water has flooded the entire area and the 4
remaining walls cannot be broken down.

Write a program that, given the coordinates of the N points, and 
the descriptions of W walls connecting these points, determines 
which of the walls are left standing after the flood.

PROBLEM NAME: flood

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains an integer N (2 <= N <= 100,000), 
the number of points in the plane.

Each of the following N lines contains two integers X and Y (both 
between 0 and 1 000 000, inclusive), the coordinates of one point. 
The points are numbered 1 to N in the order in which they are given. 
No two points will be located at the same coordinates.

The following line contains an integer W (1 <= W <= 2N), the number 
of walls.

Each of the following W lines contains two different integers A 
and B (1 <= A <= N, 1 <= B <= N), meaning that, before the flood, 
there was a wall connecting points A and B. The walls are numbered 
1 to W in the order in which they are given.

In test cases worth a total of 40 points, all coordinates will be 
at most 500.

In those same cases, and cases worth another 15 points, the number 
of points will be at most 500.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The first line of output should contain a single integer K, the 
number of walls left standing after the flood. The following K 
lines should contain the indices of the walls that are still 
standing, one wall per line. The indices must be output in 
ascending order.
