-------------------

Bob has arrived in New Jersey and he would like to visit some of the 
hockey matches. He does not have any team preferences and he does not 
have any time restrictions. If he had enough money, he would be able 
to visit all of the matches. Unfortunately, he has limited money,
all of which can be spent on tickets.

Knowing how much a ticket costs for each match, calculate the number 
of ways he can attend a set of matches without exceeding his budget.
Two ways are considered different if there exists a match which is 
visited in one of the ways, but not visited in the other.

PROBLEM NAME: hockey

INPUT FORMAT:

A description of Bob's situation is read from the standard input.
The first line of input contains two positive integers N and M
(1 <= N <= 40, 1 <= M <= 10^18), denoting the number of matches 
and dollars Bob can spend.

The second line contains N space-separated positive integers, none 
of them exceeding 10^16, representing costs of the matches in dollars.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output a single line with the number of ways Bob can visit the matches.
Please note that due to the limit on N, this number will be at most 2^40.

SAMPLE INPUT:

5 1000
100 1500 500 500 1000

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

8

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The eight possible ways are:

* no matches visited
* the match worth 100
* the first match worth 500
* the second match worth 500
* the match worth 100 and the first match worth 500
* the match worth 100 and the second match worth 500
* both matches worth 500
* the match worth 1000.

TEST DATA:

There are 20 tests. The upper bounds on N and M of tests are as follows:

              1-4    6-8    10-14    16-20
             -----------------------------
Limit on N     10     20      40       40
Limit on M   10^6   10^18    10^6    10^18
