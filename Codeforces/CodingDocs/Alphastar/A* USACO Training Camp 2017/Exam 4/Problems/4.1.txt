Mirko and Slavko are playing with toy animals. First, they choose 
one of three boards given in the figure below. Each board consists 
of cells (shown as circles in the figure) arranged into a one, two 
or three dimensional grid.

Mirko then places N little toy animals into the cells.

The distance between two cells is the smallest number of moves that 
an animal would need in order to reach one cell from the other. In 
one move, the animal may step into one of the adjacent cells 
(connected by line segments in the figure).

Two animals can hear each other if the distance between their cells 
is at most D. Slavko's task is to calculate how many pairs of 
animals there are such that one animal can hear the other.

Write a program that, given the board type, the locations of all 
animals, and the number D, finds the desired number of pairs.

PROBLEM NAME: pairs

INPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input contains four integers in this order:
* The board type B (1 <= B <= 3);
* The number of animals N (1 <= N <= 100,000);
* The largest distance D at which two animals can hear each other 
(1 <= D <= 100,000,000);
* The size of the board M (the largest coordinate allowed to appear 
in the input):
    When B=1, M will be at most 75,000,000.
    When B=2, M will be at most 75,000.
    When B=3, M will be at most 75.

Each of the following N lines contains B integers separated by 
single spaces, the coordinates of one toy animal. Each coordinate 
will be between 1 and M (inclusive). More than one animal may occupy 
the same cell.

In test cases worth a total of 30 points, the number of animals N 
will be at most 1,000.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Output should consist of a single integer, the number of pairs of 
animals that can hear each other.

Note: use a 64-bit integer type to calculate and output the result 
(long long in C/C++, long in Java).

SAMPLE INPUT 1:        SAMPLE INPUT 2:        SAMPLE INPUT 3:

Clarification for the leftmost example. Suppose the animals are 
numbered 1 through 6 in the order in which they are given. The 
four pairs are:

* 1-5 (distance 5)
* 1-6 (distance 2)
* 2-3 (distance 0)
* 5-6 (distance 3)

Clarification for the middle example. The eight pairs are:
* 1-2 (distance 2)
* 1-4 (distance 4)
* 1-5 (distance 3)
* 2-3 (distance 3)
* 2-4 (distance 4)
* 3-4 (distance 3)
* 3-5 (distance 4)
* 4-5 (distance 3)
