-------------------

Farmer John is looking for a place to build his new barn. His farm is an N
x M (1 <= N, M <= 200) grid of squares, and he has assigned each square a
certain rating (-5,000 <= rating <= 5,000) according to how high of a
quality the square is. FJ can choose any non-empty rectangular section of
the farm to place his barn on, but he will only accept a certain rectangle
if its total rating (which is the sum of the ratings of all squares inside
it) is at least some number R (-100,000,000 <= R <= 100,000,000) that he
has decided on beforehand.

Given the ratings of each square of the farm, determine how many different
possible rectangular sections FJ can use to build his new barn.

PROBLEM NAME: barnloc

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N, M, and R.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains M space-separated integers
        representing the ratings of the squares in row i of the farm.

SAMPLE INPUT:

2 3 0
1 -2 1
-2 -1 -2

INPUT DETAILS:

The farm is a 2 x 3 grid, and FJ wants a nonnegative total rating.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer representing the number of different
        rectangles FJ can choose that have a total rating of at least
        R.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ can choose either of the 1's as his rectangle, as well as the "1 -2 1"
rectangle at the top.
